# Repository Guidelines

- Always install any required dependencies so that tests can be executed locally. Do not skip running tests due to missing dependencies.
- Run the relevant test suite after making changes.
- Use Code complexity measures to keep code simple
- As part of each PR, also find the most complex function in the core codebase and work to simplify it by 10% without breaking anything
